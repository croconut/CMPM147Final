      <h2>What is this? </h2>
      <p>This is a game that pits you, a lowly mage stuck in a never ending cave system, versus legions of flying swords. 
        To play the game you'll need to kill swords that come your way and make your way to the exit to increase your final score.
        After each level you'll get character and weapon upgrades. <br>The controls are WASD to move, left-click to attack, 
        and right-click to blink.</p>
      <h2>Generative Methodologies</h2>
      <p>The map uses cellular automata to give the game space a more natural and varied feeling, with randomly placed swords and psuedo-randomly placed
        entrance and exit points. The game was created using the Phaser 3 framework, a divergence from my initial decision to use Unity as 
        creating it in Phaser 3 was faster for me, due to the course being also written in Javascript and the code transferring was pretty 
        simple compared to finding all the correct tools in Unity. The enemy AI and the player's weapon generation use the Neat class from the neataptic library to, respectively,
        hunt down the player and create better tools for the player to eliminate enemies. This Neat class is based on the Instinct 
        neuroevolution algorithm.
